## 📚 1. Project Overview

The project explores data from a music-related database through different SQL queries, categorized by difficulty:
- Beginner Level: Basic queries and aggregations.
- Medium Level: Intermediate tasks using joins and subqueries.
- Advanced Level: Complex queries utilizing CTEs, window functions, and aggregations.

---

## 🎯 2. Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Develop an understanding of SQL operations across various complexity levels.
- Explore data patterns in the music dataset.
- Derive insights about customer behavior, artist performance, and sales distribution.
